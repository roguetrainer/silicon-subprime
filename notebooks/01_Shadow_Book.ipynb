    "## The Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "You play as a **Chief Risk Officer** managing a portfolio of loans to AI Service Providers (SPVs).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Mechanic\n",
    "- **Limited Visibility**: You can see your own exposure, but you **cannot see the full \"Cap Table\"** of your borrowers\n",
    "- **Hidden Network**: Other major lenders (\"Whale\" funds like Blackstone, Blue Owl, Apollo) also have exposures you can't see\n",
    "- **Investigation Costs**: You can spend capital to investigate other lenders' positions\n",
    "- **Liquidity Decisions**: You must decide whether to maintain your loans or recall capital\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Contagion\n",
    "If a \"Whale\" lender takes a loss on a different asset, they panic and de-risk by recalling loans from *your* borrowers—draining liquidity even from healthy companies. **Your portfolio can fail through no fault of your own.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌐 Real-World Analog\n",

    "### The \"Shadow Banking\" Information Asymmetry\n",
    "\n",
    "This simulates the issue flagged by the Bank of England:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Private Credit Opacity**: Markets are bilateral and opaque\n",
    "- **Cross-Collateralization Risk**: A lender doesn't know if their borrower is cross-collateralized by another fund facing a liquidity crisis\n",
    "- **Network Effects**: In highly connected networks, a shock to one participant becomes a shock to all\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Thesis Connection\n",

    "> **\"Diversification is an illusion.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "If all lenders are exposed to the same vintage of H100 GPUs, diversification provides no protection. The network linkages mean that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Your borrower may be healthy\n",
    "2. But another lender's panic on an unrelated position\n",
    "3. Causes them to pull funding from your borrower\n",
    "4. Which forces your borrower into default\n",
    "5. Causing you to take losses\n",

    "   - BUT damages the SPV's funding health (triggers contagion)\n",
    "   - May force the SPV into default if funding drops below 70%\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **🕵️ Investigate**: Spend $10M to learn another lender's position in a target SPV\n",
    "   - Reveals hidden network exposures\n",
    "   - Helps you understand contagion risk\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **⏩ Wait**: Do nothing and advance to the next month\n",
    "   - Preserves current positions\n",
    "   - Exposes you to market events\n",
    "\n",
    "### Win/Loss Conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Game Over**: If your capital drops to $0 (fund insolvency)\n",
    "- **Survival**: Navigate through the crisis while maintaining positive capital\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Event:\n",

    "1. **Information is Power**: Early investigations can reveal which SPVs are at risk\n",
    "2. **Liquidity Management**: Balance between keeping loans deployed (earning returns) and hoarding cash (safety)\n",
    "3. **Contagion Awareness**: Your own actions contribute to contagion—recalling loans damages the network\n",
    "4. **First-Mover Advantage**: In a crisis, the first to pull capital recovers the most\n",

    "### What This Simulation Teaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Opacity Creates Systemic Risk**\n",
    "   - You cannot protect against risks you cannot see\n",
    "   - Private credit markets lack transparency into network linkages\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Diversification Fails in Connected Networks**\n",
    "   - Your three SPVs appear diversified\n",
    "   - But shared lender exposure creates hidden correlation\n",
    "   - When one \"whale\" panics, all SPVs suffer\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Contagion is Structural, Not Fundamental**\n",
    "   - SPVs can be operationally healthy\n",
    "   - But fail due to liquidity withdrawal from unrelated shocks\n",
    "   - The failure mode is **funding**, not **operations**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **First-Mover Advantage Accelerates Crises**\n",
    "   - Rational players have incentive to pull capital early\n",
    "   - This creates a self-fulfilling prophecy\n",
    "   - Cooperative equilibrium is unstable\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the AI compute financing market:\n",
    "- Large private credit funds (Blackstone, Blue Owl, Apollo, Ares) all lend to GPU-backed SPVs\n",
    "- These positions are not disclosed publicly\n",
    "- A shock to GPU valuations (e.g., next-gen chip release) affects ALL lenders simultaneously\n",
    "- The first to exit recovers capital; the last faces total loss\n",
    "- This structure guarantees **fire sales** during stress\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔗 Connection to Other Simulations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Game 2 (The Syndicate)**: Explores the prisoner's dilemma dynamics when lenders know they're interconnected\n",
    "- **Game 3 (Tranche Defense)**: Shows how individual SPV capital structures fail under asset depreciation\n",
