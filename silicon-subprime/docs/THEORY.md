# The Silicon Subprime Thesis: A Systemic Risk Overview

## 1. Introduction: The "Meta-Bubble"
We observe a structural isomorphism between the 2025 AI "Compute" market and the 2007 MBS market. The core thesis is that **Duration Mismatch** and **Collateral Depreciation** in Private Credit have created a fragile system.

## 2. The Framework: The "Four Ls"

### **L1: Loss (The Depreciation Cliff)**
* **Asset:** H100 GPUs are deflationary.
* **Risk:** The Blackwell release collapses H100 rental rates, driving Loss Given Default (LGD) to >60%.

### **L2: Leverage (Institutional)**
* **Structure:** "Neoclouds" borrow at 80-90% Loan-to-Cost (LTC).
* **Operating Leverage:** High fixed debt service vs. volatile spot revenues.

### **L2.5: Retail Margin (The Valuation Feedback Loop)**
While Private Credit funds the *infrastructure*, Retail Traders fund the *valuation*.
* **Mechanism:** Retail buys AI stocks (Nvidia) on margin/options.
* **Risk:** A "Gamma Squeeze" in reverse. If stocks drop >10%, automated broker liquidations force massive selling. This crushes the collateral value that underpins the Private Credit deals.

### **L3: Liquidity (The Refinancing Wall)**
* **Liability:** 3-5 year "Private Credit" facilities (Interest-Only).
* **Asset:** By 2028, the H100s will be e-waste.
* **Trap:** No bank will refinance a $1B loan on e-waste.

### **L4: Linkages (The Contagion Map)**
* **Circular Financing:** Tech Giants -> Startups -> Debt -> Tech Giants (Revenue).
* **Syndicate Concentration:** Mega-Funds (Blackstone, Blue Owl) dominate. A loss in one deal causes liquidity withdrawal in others.
