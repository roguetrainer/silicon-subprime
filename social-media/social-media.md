Here are three options for your social media post, ranging from a professional LinkedIn "Thought Leadership" style to a punchy Twitter/X thread, and finally a more technical version for developer communities.

First, here is the podcast title you requested:
**"Why Paul Kedrosky Says AI Is Like Every Bubble All Rolled Into One"**

### Option 1: LinkedIn (The "Narrative Arc" Approach)
*Best for reaching recruiters, hiring managers, and industry peers.*

**Headline: Is the AI Boom just 2008 with better GPUs?**

I’ve been hearing the "Cassandras" get louder lately regarding the sustainability of the AI infrastructure build-out. A recent episode of the *Odd Lots* podcast ("Why Paul Kedrosky Says AI Is Like Every Bubble All Rolled Into One") really crystallized the question: Are we facing a standard market correction, or is the financial system itself in peril?

Cautious not to "fight the last war," I started a coding experiment to see if the frameworks we used to analyze the Great Financial Crisis—specifically the "Four Ls" of Systemic Risk (Loss, Leverage, Liquidity, Linkages)—could apply to the current AI Private Credit bubble.

What started as a theoretical "what if" became very real this week. While I was building these models, the Bank of England issued its December 2025 Financial Stability Report. Despite their conservative nature, they are ringing the exact same alarm bells about opacity, leverage, and valuation stretch.

I’ve open-sourced this work in a new repo: **Silicon Subprime**.

It includes a whitepaper and three interactive simulations (games) that demonstrate how these risks manifest:
* **THE SHADOW BOOK:** Modeling network contagion.
* **THE SYNDICATE:** A Prisoner's Dilemma of liquidity runs.
* **TRANCHE DEFENSE:** Surviving the capital waterfall.

I can’t guarantee the games are "fun" in the traditional sense, but they are designed to be strictly educational. The goal isn't finger-pointing; it's about building financial literacy. By understanding the mechanics of the machine, perhaps we can moderate the boom/bust cycle and avoid the dangerous excesses of the past.

### Option 2: Twitter / X (The "Hook & Thread" Approach)
*Best for engagement and quick clicks.*

**Tweet 1:**
The "Cassandras" are right. The AI bubble isn't just about high stock prices; it's about the financial plumbing. 🧵

I built a simulation to test if the 2008 financial crisis framework applies to 2025 AI financing. The results were startling.

**Tweet 2:**
Inspired by Paul Kedrosky on @OddLotsPods, I modeled the "Four Ls" of systemic risk:
L1: Loss (Depreciation)
L2: Leverage (Private Credit)
L3: Liquidity (Refi Walls)
L4: Linkages (Contagion)

Then, the Bank of England dropped their Dec '25 report confirming exactly what my code was showing.

**Tweet 3:**
I’ve turned these models into a repo called **Silicon Subprime**.

It contains 3 interactive games/simulations. They aren't "fun" (unless you like margin calls), but they illustrate how hidden risks lurk out of sight in the Private Credit network.

**Tweet 4:**
This isn't about finger-pointing. It's about understanding system dynamics so we don't repeat history.

### Option 3: The "Technical/Quant" Approach
*Best for Reddit (r/algotrading, r/finance) or Hacker News.*

**Title: I built a Monte Carlo simulation of the AI Private Credit bubble. Then the BoE validated it.**

**Body:**
Like many of you, I listened to the recent *Odd Lots* episode with Paul Kedrosky and started wondering about the systemic risk of GPU-backed lending. I wanted to know: Is the "Silicon Subprime" thesis mathematically sound?

I built a repo to model this using the IMF’s "Four Ls" framework (Loss, Leverage, Liquidity, Linkages). I implemented Bipartite Graph projections to model network contagion and waterfall simulations to test loan-to-value covenants against Moore's Law depreciation curves.

Midway through the project, the Bank of England released their Dec 2025 Financial Stability Report, flagging the exact same risks (opacity in private credit, leverage, and correlation) that my models were highlighting.

The repo includes:
1.  **Docs:** A breakdown of the "Meta-Bubble" thesis.
2.  **Code:** Python/Jupyter implementations of the risk models.
3.  **Games:** 3 interactive simulations (Gradio/Jupyter) that let you play as a Risk Officer trying to survive a liquidity crunch.

This is an educational project aimed at understanding market microstructure and contagion, not a trading signal. Feedback on the code and the financial logic is welcome.
